Spotify's most popular songs, artists and albums

a. Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate based on the Spotify data list, the most accessed artists, albums, and songs. This is very fluctuating data because in the second that you read this word, the numbers of all data that I am demonstrating have already changed. There are countless simultaneous accesses in the world. So this base is used as a reference and cannot be exact data.

b. The Dataset
The dataset that I am using in this project was created by Maharshi Pandya and can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset The dataset is a .csv file.

c. Other’s Findings
There is a person asking about the authenticity of this data set. 

d. Sources
I obtained my data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset

e. Summary
After converting the data to a GitHub repository, I imported it into Google Colab and began to explore the information I had using pandas. First it worked fine but I had a problem later working on my project where my data wasn’t being accessed. So, Bri helped to upload it directly to Google Colab, the first attempt uploading the file didn’t worked either, but I could load it using a Python code: “from google.colab import files” and “uploaded = files.upload()”. I calculated the mean, median, and mode. Then I went to work manipulating the dataframe in order to best access the variables I was looking to compare and visualize. Using matplotlib I was able to make various graphs exploring the Spotify data.

f. Graphs
Graphs must be filtered to use due to large amount of data. The graph I used the most was the bar style, which I believe has the best visualization.

g. Conclusion
I'm new to programming, I only have basic knowledge of HTML. I was so happy with my result, being able to run my code without errors and extract some interesting information. Music is a theme that I really like, I'm always listening to and it was the first suggestion of data for us to use and when I saw it I chose it. I know that there are a lot to be explored, improved and I intend to do this with more time and learn more filters and codes. It was something very challenging and enjoyable.
